# LC3Tools [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chiragsakhuja/lc3tools.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chiragsakhuja/lc3tools)
LC3Tools is a modern set of tools to build code for and simulate the LC-3
system described in *Introduction to Computing* by Dr. Yale Patt and Dr. Sanjay
Patel.

This project has the following aims:

* Consistent cross-platform support (across Windows, macOS, and Linux)
* Consistent behavior across the GUI, command line tools, and other applications
* Intuitive user interface
* Powerful testing API for unit tests and auto-graders
* Well-documented, simple, open-source code base

All of the code for the project lives in this repository, but it can be broken
down into three components: a set of command line tools, a GUI, and a series of
unit tests.

## Quick Start
LC3Tools has two primary use cases.  Students will genenerally use the GUI,
which can be downloaded from the
[Releases](https://github.com/chiragsakhuja/lc3tools/releases) tab.  For
information on which download is correct for you, refer to the
[downloading/installing guide](DownloadingAndInstalling.pdf).  To learn how to
use the GUI, refer to the [beginniner's usage guide](GuideToUsingLC3Tools.pdf).

Instructors, or students who are comfortable with the command line, will
generally use the command line tools, which is also the only way to write unit
tests.  Note that auto-graders are written as unit tests.  To get started,
follow these steps, which can be performed on any supported platform:
1. Ensure you have [CMake](https://cmake.org) and a C++11 compiler installed.
2. Build the command line utilities from source as described in the 
   [build document](BUILD.md#command-line-tools-and-unit-tests).
3. Follow the unit test tutorial in the [unit test document](TEST.md).
4. Refer to the [command line tools document](CLI.md).
5. Refer to the samples provided in the `src/test/tests/samples` directory.
6. Refer to the [API document](API.md) to learn about the full unit testing
   capabilities.
7. (For instructors) Refer to the [Grader document](GRADER.md) to learn about
   the script that performs batch grading in a classroom context.

In some cases, instructors may want to modify the GUI as well.  In addition to
the requirements for the command line utilities, you will need to have
[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) installed.
The [build document](BUILD.md#gui) also contains directions on how to build the
GUI.

## Additional Information
More details on how to use the individual components can be found in the
[command line tools](CLI.md), [GUI](GUI.md), and [unit test](TEST.md)
documents.
